            <div class="content">Solaris is a discord server where people from all around the world chat with each other. Solaris is basically is a hangout and Homework space themed server. We can chat together, exchange our thoughts, share our feelings and if you are having trouble with your homework, we can help you and help others with their homework and have a friendly chat.

          <div class="content">Solaris was created with a vision of putting together a community of astronomy enthusiasts as well as people from all other walks of life who admire the night sky (and people who romantically fantasise about it). We also have regular hangout channels, meme threads, photography dumps, a channel displaying mouth watering cuisines curated by our contributors from around the world, and also channels featuring an extremely creative subset from among us. Additionally, we have topic channels to bring out the best in you. Whether you're a cook, an enthusiast gamer, an anime fan, a full-time nerd or you like vagabonding around the world instead (with a lot of stories to tell), we've gotchu! We'd describe ourselves as another hangout discord society suited to the adolescent and early adult age group. Yeah, we got academic discussion channels, too... and a few others to instigate the astro-fanatics out there who would like to join our community :)

              <br>
            <p>I was getting bored alone during the pandemic so I joined a random discord server and luckily I got to meet some genuinely nice people who really had the skill and a sense of humor to carry out a fun and friendly  conversation. Moreover, I made friends online, most of us were common friends of each other and sadly I started loosing touch with some so i decided to gather everyone, starting with who I had the most conversation with. They assisted me decorating the entire server and almost did the entire server, especially decorating it like an actual server....I m really grateful to everyone for coming forward, assisting me and making this server alive. :)
